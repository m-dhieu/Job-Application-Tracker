# Job Application Tracker


## Overview


This application is a backend FastAPI service integrated with a simple frontend. It leverages external APIs and provides a meaningful user experience by allowing user authentication, personalized data handling, and other interactive features. The app is designed for deployment on a load-balanced infrastructure for scalability and availability. It simulates a job (tech roles) application tracker.

**Key functionalities include:**  
- User job application tracking (CRUD)  
- Fetching new job listings (tech roles) from external APIs  
- Resume/CV review tailored to job applications  
- Skill gap analysis and resource recommendations  
- Essay (cover letter) grammar feedback

## Local Setup & Running


### Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/m-dhieu/Job-Application-Tracker.git

`cd Job-Application-Tracker`


### Run the application with a Docker container locally:

`docker compose up -d --build`

Ensure you have Docker installed

Open your browser at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

The frontend JS should call the backend APIs at http://localhost:8080.


### Test locally:

`curl http://localhost:8080`


---


## Docker: Building and Running Locally


### Build Docker image:


From project root:

`docker build -f backend/Dockerfile -t mydockerhubusername/myimagename:v1 .`


### Run Docker container locally:

`docker run -p 8080:8080 mydockerhubusername/myimagename:v1`


Test API:

`curl http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login`

or: 

`curl http://localhost:8080`

Adjust the endpoint as per the app routes.

Note: A straightforward way is to bring up the lab environment from the project root to build the image on the first run, as shown in [image1](https://imgpx.com/7UWcQHRBcP4J.jpg), [image2](https://imgpx.com/U5m6XldJ1s8J.png), and [image3](https://imgpx.com/KVURgDE52Zdy.jpg). Use:

`docker compose up -d --build`


---


## Deployment on Lab Servers


### On Web01 and Web02 nodes:


SSH into each server and perform:

`docker pull mydockerhubusername/myimagename:v1` 

`docker run -d --name appname --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 mydockerhubusername/myimagename:v1`


Confirm app accessibility at:

- [web-01](http://52.91.19.144:8088) 
- [web-02](http://13.221.66.135:8080)
- [@mdhieu.tech](http://mdhieu.tech:8088)

## Configuring Load Balancer on Lb01


Edit `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` (or your mounted config) to include:

- backend webapps
- balance roundrobin
- server web01 172.20.0.11:8080 check
- server web02 172.20.0.12:8080 check


Reload HAProxy:

`docker exec -it lb-01 sh -c 'haproxy -sf $(pidof haproxy) -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg'`


---


## Testing Load Balancer


From your host machine:

`curl http://localhost`

Run multiple times and confirm response data alternates between Web01 and Web02 instances, proving effective round-robin load balancing.

You can loop and create custom headers like 'mdhieu' for 'web01' and 'aben' for 'web02', as shown in [image](https://imgpx.com/Bfoc9E7VQEod.png).

## Security and API Key Handling


- API keys such as `RAPIDAPI_KEY` are passed as environment variables and never baked into the Docker image.  
- This practice secures sensitive credentials from being exposed publicly in repositories or container images.


Example running container with environment variable:

`docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e RAPIDAPI_KEY="your_actual_rapidapi_key" yourdockerhubusername/yourimagename:v1`


---


## Challenges and Solutions


- Configuring correct filesystem paths inside containers to serve frontend static files alongside backend API. Resolved via proper relative path computation.  
- Ensuring Docker build context included all necessary files for both frontend and backend.  
- Setting up and validating HAProxy load balancer configuration for seamless request distribution.  
- Securing API keys from exposure using environment variables.

View documentation after running the application at [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs) to see a list of endpoints and schemas grouped under main prefixes based on the routers in my backend app setup. These organize all the API endpoints exposed for my application. These include: Job application tracking, CRUD actions, Resume/CV review and tailoring, Cover letter/essay grammar feedback, Skill gap analysis and recommendations, User authentication (login/signup), User management
